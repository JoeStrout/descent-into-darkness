This folder contains "library" code, i.e., general-purpose modules
that have no dependencies on anything else in the project.  They do
one job, and they would be just as happy doing it in some other
project.

Anything more specific to this game, or that's not so neatly
encapsulated, belongs in the code folder instead.
