This file lists near-term things-to-do that involve writing new code (or maybe refactoring existing code).


- add mouse movement
- add ability to look up/down (within a limited range)
- add collision handling with the walls
- create a proper main program
- set up neat, organized system for code to generate/load each level
- add "pit" decoration (draws a pit/ladder leading down)
- enable traveling between levels
