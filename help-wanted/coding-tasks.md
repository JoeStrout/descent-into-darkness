This file lists near-term things-to-do that involve writing new code (or maybe refactoring existing code).

## New Code

- enable mobs to attack the player, updating player health
- add "ceiling pit" decoration (leads upwards)
- enable traveling between levels


## Fixes (Known Issues)

- renderer doesn't draw nearby geometry (when it gets clipped by the camera plane)
- you can't shoot through open doors
- mesh objects warp differently from walls at sharp angles, causing walls around doorways to appear bent
