This file lists near-term things-to-do that involve writing new code (or maybe refactoring existing code).

- add "pit" decoration (draws a pit/ladder leading down)
- add "ceiling pit" (leads upwards)
- enable traveling between levels
- fix occasional failure of renderer to draw nearby geometry (when it gets clipped by the camera plane)
