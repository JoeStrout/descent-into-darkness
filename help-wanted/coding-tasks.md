This file lists near-term things-to-do that involve writing new code (or maybe refactoring existing code).

- add ability to look up/down (within a limited range)
- create a proper main program
- set up neat, organized system for code to generate/load each level
- add "pit" decoration (draws a pit/ladder leading down)
- enable traveling between levels
- fix occasional failure of walls to join properly at an inside corner
- fix occasional failure of renderer to draw some distant geometry off to the side of a near occluder
