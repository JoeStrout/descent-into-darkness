The art-sources folder contains source files for some of the original art assets in the game.

Note that it will *not* include any commercial/licensed models (or fonts) from which we have generated pre-rendered sprites (or bytemap fonts).  We can't post that stuff to GitHub.  But it can contain any models or drawing documents that we make ourselves.

Here are some of the file extensions you may see here:

- .idraw: a document from Graphic (a Mac vector drawing app).
